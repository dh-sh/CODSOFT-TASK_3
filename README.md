# CODSOFT-TASK_3


The process of building a classification model for the Iris dataset involved several steps, starting with loading and exploring the dataset. The dataset contained 150 samples with four numerical features representing sepal and petal measurements and a categorical target representing the species. Since the dataset was clean and well-structured, no preprocessing was needed apart from encoding the categorical labels.

After splitting the data into training and testing sets, a Random Forest classifier was chosen as the model due to its robustness and ability to handle multi-class classification effectively. The model was trained using an 80-20 split, and its performance was evaluated on the test data. The results showed that the model achieved 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified all test samples without errors. The precision, recall, and F1-scores for all three species were also perfect, indicating that the dataset had clear class separations and that the model was well-suited for the task.

Overall, the classification task was successful, and the Random Forest model proved to be highly effective in distinguishing between the three Iris species based on their measurements. The high accuracy suggests that the dataset is well-defined and suitable for machine learning classification tasks.
